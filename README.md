# Failed SSH logins
Ever wonder who's trying to brute force login into your server? 

This tool sends these IP's to the Virus total API. 

The result is a few different things such as: 
ISP owner, malware positives, hashes of malware positives, known hostnames hosting malware and origin country. 

## Installation

To use this tool please run the following command in your working folder:
 ```bash 
egrep 'Failed password for invalid' /var/log/auth.log | awk '{print $13}' 
```
Generating the Virus Total API keys: 
Login or create an account on Virus total, once logged in click on your name in the top right > API key.

Note: This API is limited, 4 request per minute.

Once you have replaced the API key in ip-scan.py you will simply run ``` python3 ip-scan.py ```

## Web interface

The failed ssh folder contains the web interface, you will usually place this folder in /var/www/html/ or wherever you have your website files hosted. 

Note: The script generates json files in /var/www/html/failed-ssh/json/



## Contributing

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
